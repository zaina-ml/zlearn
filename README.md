# zLearn

A small machine learning library.

The library contains basic functionalities. Basic MLPs can be created alongside basic datatypes and tensors. Forward pass functionality is also included. 
*However, there is no training functionality*

Its core purpose is comparatively analyzing its own computational speed vs PyTorch's computional speed at forward passes of a simple MLP. 

# Project Results

zLearn time: 0.01182103157043457
PyTorch Time: 0.001827239990234375

Really cool! zLearn is about 10x slower than PyTorch, showing how optimized PyTorch is!
